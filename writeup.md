From the beginning of 2021, I would write up a piece each other on a topic of quant knowledge. It can be pricing, stress test, data, market news and views, random thoughts etc.

The purpose of doing it is to:
1. Reflect learning and thinking
2. Articulate writing 
3. Sharing domain knowledge with people who have similar interests
4. Pass time during Covid-19 lockdown : )

Week 1 Jan 17-Jan 23: Personal Investment    

I started to invest some personal saving after I started to work and received incomes from early 2020. What a year! The market crashed in March and quickly underwent a V-shape receovery with the rescue from FED. I am one of those who lost confidence in market and sold in late March and didn't buy again until July. Well, I missed a significant amount of boucing back and my portfolio (both 401k and personal stock portfolios) has underperformed the benchmark. That was the mistake in market timing. 

But that was not the only mistake. I really believe Alibaba is a great company and the stock is a great stock. So I bought 20 shares when its price pearked at round $290/share : )
Then its price plumbed after Jack Ma's speach of regulation deficiency of financial innovation and the Chinese government launched anti trust invetigation in Ant group and Alibaba. The BABA stock takes more than 60% of my portfolio and it didn't come back until now. I should have diversified, but anyway I determine to hold it for long horizon.

Week 2 Jan 24-Jan 30: Performance Attribution

This week I was asked about the idea or methodology of Performance Attribution. While I had a rough idea of how PA works, I failed to convery in clear points to the interviewer and it was obviously not a satisfactory interview result. So I wanted to take the chance of reflecting my understanding of PA framework.

The Performance Attribution wants to decompose the period returns into different risk factors or return drivers. Firstlyï¼Œ it considers local market return and fx return. Secondly, in local market, it wants to break down total returns into two parts: holding it while assuming market conditions are unchanged and returns attributed to market condition changes. Carry returns are simply holding the position and letting it age - the passage of time will pull the maturity closer and roll down the yield curve. Another type of carry is spread carry, since spread is also source of yield. When considering the market condition changes, we can also consider the interest rate term structure changes and credit spread changes. There are other flexible ways to attribute returns to different buckets.
