#### About me:

I am a second year quant finance master's student at the University of Michigan. In the web page, I would like to showcase the mathematical models and technical tools with projects I have worked on. My interests are in the fields of quantative analysis, risk analytics, data science and machine learning.

#### Student Led Workshop
The workshop of the Quant program is led by students for discussion of ... on friday morning. See [here](https://dlu-umich.github.io/friday-workshop/) for details. 

#### Risk Management
VaR monitor with parametric, historical, Monte Carlo VaR calculation to carve [risk profiles](https://github.com/dlu-umich/RiskApp) of portfolios.

#### Machine Learning
In flight

#### Programming Practice
- Dynamic programmming: [red&black marbles](https://github.com/dlu-umich/Quant-Lab)

#### Mathematical Modeling:
 - Jane Street's [Min Max Correlation](https://pbenson.github.io/quant-projects/JaneStreetCorrelationProblem.JPG) puzzle:
 I worked on a math puzzle from [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/) and presented to the class.
 - Numerical Methods

#### Data Manipulation
I studied data manipulation and analysis methods from SI 816 with the School of Information. Having appied 
- Seaborn for visualization
- SpaCy for nature language processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- course project - Cryptocurrency [Trading Data Anaysis](https://github.com/dlu-umich/Data-Manipulation-and-Analysis).
