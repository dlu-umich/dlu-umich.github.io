#### About me:

I am a second year quant finance master's student at the University of Michigan. In this page, I would like to showcase the mathematical models and technical tools with projects I have worked on. My interests are in the fields of quantitative modeling, risk analytics and machine learning.

#### Student Led Workshop
The workshop of the Quant program is led by students for discussion of quant finance problems on friday morning. See [here](https://dlu-umich.github.io/friday-workshop/) for details. 

#### Risk Management
VaR monitor with parametric, historical, Monte Carlo VaR calculation to carve the risk profile of portfolios.

#### Machine Learning
In flight

#### Programming Practice
- Dynamic programmming: [red&black marbles](https://github.com/dlu-umich/Quant-Lab)

#### Mathematical Modeling:
 - Jane Street's [Min Max Correlation](https://pbenson.github.io/quant-projects/JaneStreetCorrelationProblem.JPG) puzzle:
 I worked on a math puzzle from [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/) and presented to the class.
 - Numerical Methods

#### Data Manipulation
I studied data manipulation and analysis methods from SI 816 with the School of Information. Having appied 
- Seaborn for visualization
- SpaCy for nature language processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- course project - Cryptocurrency [Trading Data Anaysis](https://github.com/dlu-umich/Data-Manipulation-and-Analysis).

#### Miscellaneous
- You have 1000 coins. 999 are fair. 1 have 2 heads. You randomly pick one and toss it 10 times. It comes out 10 heads. What is the probability you pick the coin with the two heads?
