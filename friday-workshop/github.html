            <h3>What GitHub is for</h3>

            <p>GitHub is web-hosted source code repository that uses git. Think of it as a file system, with the ability to retrieve past versions of files. You work on local versions of the files. When you want to keep a version of files you've changed,
                you <em>commit</em> your changes, and the changes are stored in a local databse. When you want your committed changes to be stored on the web, you <em>sync</em> with GitHub.</p>

            <h3>How we use GitHub</h3>
            <h4>Writing code based on an existing repo</h4>
            <p>Most of the time we are using GitHub to support code development. There are several ways you can get this code:

                <details>
                    <summary>Forking and cloning</summary>
                    <p>If you intend to submit your changes for inclusion in the master copy:
                        <ol>
                            <li>From the home page of the project you intend to fork (e.g.<a href="https://github.com/pbenson/umich-quant">umich-quant</a>), click the fork button in the upper right. This creates a linked copy of the project in your personal
                                repository.
                            </li>

                            <li>Using the GitHub Desktop client, or from the home page of your newly forked repo, clone the forked repo. Now you can start coding.</li>

                            <li>When you are ready to submit your changes, first commit and sync. Then do a <em>pull request</em> from GitHub Desktop. </li>

                            <li>If you change your mind, and decide you don't want your changes, you can delete your local (cloned) repo, and from the website, delete the forked repo.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Directly cloning</summary>
                    <p>If you just want to get a complete copy of the code, and don't intend to submit changes to the the original repo via a pull request, then you can just directly clone the repo. From the home page of the project you intend to fork (e.g.<a href="https://github.com/pbenson/umich-quant">umich-quant</a>), click the clone button in the upper right. This will direct you to GitHub Desktop.
                    </p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Copying and pasting</summary>
                    <p>Often we may only be working with a couple of files. If you only want to use those files, you can copy and paste from the original repo (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/umich-quant">umich-quant</a>).
                    </p>
                </details>

            </p>

            <h4>Website development</h4>
            <p>We use GitHub for maintaining personal websites (e.g. <a href="http://pbenson.github.io">pbenson.githum.io</a>). These websites always have URLs of the form <em>githubusername.github.io</a>.  </p>
